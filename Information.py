[green][3][/green] [yellow]Phishing[/yellow] is a deceptive cyber attack aimed at acquiring sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and financial details. 
    Perpetrators impersonate trustworthy entities through fraudulent emails, messages, or websites, often mimicking legitimate 
    institutions like banks or social media platforms. [yellow]Psychological manipulation[/yellow] tactics, urgency, enticing offers, and exploiting 
    current events are common in phishing attempts. Users must exercise caution, verify communication authenticity, and be wary of 
    unexpected requests for sensitive information to avoid falling prey to such schemes. Regular [yellow]cybersecurity awareness[/yellow] and education 
    are crucial for preventing successful phishing attacks.

    attacks with the [yellow]FACIAL CAMERA[/yellow]

[green][6][/green] [yellow]Protecting oneself against phishing[/yellow] requires a combination of vigilance, awareness, and security practices. First and foremost, 
    individuals should be cautious when receiving unexpected emails, messages, or requests for sensitive information. [yellow]Verify the legitimacy[/yellow] of 
    the sender or website by double-checking email addresses and ensuring the use of secure connections (look for "https://"). [yellow]Avoid clicking 
    on suspicious links[/yellow] and refrain from downloading attachments from unknown sources.

    Employing [yellow]multi-factor authentication[/yellow] adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification beyond passwords. Regularly updating 
    and using reputable [yellow]antivirus software[/yellow] helps detect and mitigate potential phishing threats. Additionally, staying informed about [yellow]common phishing
    tactics[/yellow], such as urgency or enticing offers, enhances the ability to recognize and avoid such scams.

    [yellow]Cybersecurity education[/yellow] is paramount. Individuals should be aware of phishing techniques, attend awareness programs, and stay informed about the 
    latest cybersecurity trends. By combining these practices, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks.
